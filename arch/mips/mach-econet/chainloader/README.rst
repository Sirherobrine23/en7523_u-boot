EN751221 BootROM XMODEM chainloader
===================================

What it is
----------

``en751221-chainloader.bin`` is a ~9 KiB standalone loader for the EN751221
internal BootROM recovery path. The BootROM downloads it to ``0x80009000``
over XMODEM and jumps there; it then pulls an **unmodified** ``u-boot.bin``
over XMODEM into ``CONFIG_TEXT_BASE`` and jumps to it.

Nothing in U-Boot proper changes. This replaces an earlier attempt at linking
U-Boot itself at ``0x80009000`` so the BootROM could load it directly, which
needed ``SKIP_LOWLEVEL_INIT``, ``SKIP_RELOCATE``, a second ``TEXT_BASE``, a
second device tree and SoC breadcrumbs inside ``arch/mips/cpu/start.S`` and
``common/board_f.c``.

Use
---

Enable ``CONFIG_ECONET_BOOTROM_CHAINLOADER`` (default ``y`` on
``TARGET_EN751221``) and ``make``. The image lands next to ``u-boot.bin``.

Hold the board in BootROM recovery, send the chainloader with the BootROM's
own XMODEM, then send ``u-boot.bin`` to the chainloader::

  picocom -b 115200 --send-cmd "<path>/xsend.sh" /dev/ttyUSB0

Send ``u-boot.bin`` **through a wrapper that flushes the serial input queue**
before running ``sx``::

  #!/bin/sh
  python3 -c 'import termios; termios.tcflush(0, termios.TCIFLUSH)'
  exec sx -k -X "$@"

Without the flush, the ``'C'`` characters the receiver emits while waiting pile
up in the host's input queue. ``sx`` consumes one during the handshake and
reads the rest in place of the first ACK; in lrzsz ``case WANTCRC:`` falls
through to ``case NAK:``, so every one of them prints ``Retry N: NAK on
sector`` until ``Retry Count Exceeded``. ``-k`` uses 1 KiB blocks: 367 instead
of 2936 for a 375 KiB ``u-boot.bin``.

Three SoC quirks this had to work around
----------------------------------------

**1. Uncached 8-bit stores corrupt the rest of the word.** An ``sb`` to
uncached DRAM becomes a read-modify-write on the peripheral bus whose read side
returns stale bus data, so the other three bytes of the word come back as
leftovers of unrelated transactions. Measured on the board, writing
``0x10..0x1f`` with byte stores and reading back as words::

  KSEG0 cached:   10111213 14151617 18191a1b 1c1d1e1f
  KSEG1 uncached: 10101210 14101610 08100a10 0c100e10

The chainloader therefore runs with ``Config.K0 = 3`` (cached), keeps its stack
in KSEG0, and receives U-Boot into cached memory. ``chainload_jump`` does
``Index_Writeback_Inv_D`` plus ``Index_Invalidate_I`` before handing over, so
the received image is in DRAM, and leaves KSEG0 uncached for U-Boot to
reconfigure.

**2. The UART needs a settle between LSR and RBR.** ``LSR.DR`` going high does
not mean ``RBR`` is valid yet; reading it immediately returns bus leftovers.
The vendor driver has the same workaround::

  /* tc3162_uart.c */
  #define READ_OTHER(x) ((x & 0xc) + 0xbfb003a0)
  tmp = VPint(READ_OTHER(CR_UART_RBR));  wmb();
  ch  = UART_RDL(CR_UART_RBR);           wmb();

``uart_rx_settle()`` does the equivalent with a register this board is known to
tolerate. All UART access is 32-bit; the registers are 32-bit spaced
(``RBR/THR`` 0x00, ``IER`` 0x04, ``IIR/FCR`` 0x08, ``LCR`` 0x0c, ``MCR`` 0x10,
``LSR`` 0x14) at ``0xbfbf0000``.

**3. The BootROM leaves dirty cache lines.** It writes the downloaded image
through the cache, so ``start.S`` writes back and invalidates before touching
anything. ``LSR`` bit 6 (TEMT) is never asserted on this part, so nothing waits
on it.

Self-check
----------

The BootROM validates its own XMODEM download with an 8-bit checksum, which
lets corruption through. ``tools/econet_chainloader_image.py`` stores a CRC32 of
the image in its last loaded word and pads to 128 bytes; the chainloader
recomputes it in DRAM and refuses to continue on a mismatch::

  EN751221 BootROM chainloader
  XMODEM 128/1k, CRC16 ou checksum -> 0x81000000
  ticks/ms=0x00070627 self len=0x000021f4 crc=0x174efbda want=0x174efbda OK

Everything mutable lives in ``.bss``, which is outside the checked region and
zeroed by ``start.S`` (the BootROM's XMODEM padding lands there).

There is no wall clock, so ``calibrate()`` derives CP0 Count ticks per
millisecond from the time the banner took to shift out at 115200 8N1. Timeouts,
the 3 s handshake cadence and the purge-before-NAK all hang off that.

On failure the report gives ``blocks=`` ``dup=`` ``tries=`` ``mode=`` ``err=``
``lsrerr=`` plus the first error: ``kind`` 1 bad header, 2 intra-packet
timeout, 3 CRC/checksum, 4 out-of-sequence, with the first 16 bytes received.
